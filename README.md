This is my code files for the implementation of RSA crypto system which I did. ptext is where you enter your plain text.
CIPHER is the file in which you'll get your corresponding ciphertext after running keygen and browmod1.
After running Server which takes CIPHER as input and decrypts it into another file called DECPT.
